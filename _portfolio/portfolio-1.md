An R Shiny application from North Carolina State University's Master's program in Statistics (ST 558) using 2014 Public Library Survey data. [View application](https://krcalvert.shinyapps.io/PLS2014/)

The goal of this project was to create a nice looking shiny app that can be used to explore data and model it. It was required to have dynamic UI elements, supervised and unsupervised learning models, and options for users to interact with the data, set options, and save data.
